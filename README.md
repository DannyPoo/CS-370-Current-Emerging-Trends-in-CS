The code in the file was given except the Q-Train code block. There was some pseudocode but then I implented all the code in Qtrain block. 
Computer scientist code programs and study the way programs work in order to better understand the software that is being put out. It is important because software runs majority of the world today and they are behind many of the technological innovations we see today. Computer scientist approach problems by understanding the problems, then analyzing the problem, then planning the solution, then develop the solution to said problem, then they optimzie and refine the solution, and finally the reflect and learn from the problems they may experienced themselves developing the solution. The ethical responbilites from CS is about privacy and data protection, security, transparency, non-discrimination and fairness, accessibility, honesty and integrity, and user well-being. When creating a program or software the programmer needs to make the software doesn't have negative impact on their users well being, privacy, or security. They also need to make sure their program is transparent in what it does and has no discrimination. The programmer itself needs to be honest and have integrity.
